Ideas
-----
- NEW: Vietnam and Korea
  - war between Molthune and Nirmathas, with some Cheliaxan intrigue
  - slow XP track
  - epic 6 system
  - PCs start as level 0 or 1 experts
  - Molthune has invaded Nirmathas and holds a line across the southern rivers
    to the Mindspin mountains
  - Our PCs start at a large forward training and staging base
  - They do training and are selected as ward walkers or something
    - They make level 1 and also get some extra feats
  - They do a brief tour of duty patrolling the river delta, which is a
    dangerous and nasty war of ambush and murder
  - They are then sent to the mountains, travelling as escorts on a supply train
  - The mountain war is a stalemate punctuated with deadly raids and ambushes
  - In the mountains, they patrol and man observation posts, dealing with
    natural and man-made dangers
    - earn some extra feats here too (endurance and such)
  - Nidalian raiders fuck with the ward walkers too
  - After they level a couple times (this should take a month or two) they head
    back down to the plains for a big offensive
    - this is when they see the brutal reality of the molthusian war machine and
      must choose their side
- NEW: war between Cheliax and Molthune
  - fought in Molthune (Cheliax invaded)
    - front lines stretch from south of the river below Kraggadan, across the
      Backar Forest (which is devestated, burned, twisted) and across the Nosam
      River well south of Canorate
  - PCs are pressed into Molthune army (kidnapped from Nirmathas?)
- high level themes
  - war, obvs, but lots of its horror and waste. should not be pleasant
  - maybe their country is the evil one? they could be from the country to the
    east of Darkmoon Vale; they only find this out later
  - find epic magical items in underground crypts - alien and otherworldly
    architecture
- have players roll civilians (2nd level experts or something); then they can
  level in the field
  - use epic 6 system
- base they are taken to is a outpost on the western fringe of the war
  - impassable desert to the west
  - to the north is mountainous badlands: this is where they will be patrolling
  - to the east, the lines converge to semi-static trench warfare
  - BETTER: adapt Darkwood Dale to work for the campaign
  - training/staging base
    - layout based on SF bases from Vietnam or Afghanistan
    - "recruits" are sent out on patrol almost immediately
      - those that fail die on patrol or are shipped to the front: a death
        sentence
      - plenty of maimed veterans working in the camp
- no dragons permanently based at the outpost
  - they rotate in, but are responsible for patrolling a large area, so not
    always on station to support the PCs
  - perhaps have drakes or something with them (but not mounted)
  - have two there when PCs arrive
  - maybe wyverns or eagles as well
- PCs patrol with 3-4 other new conscripts and 3 experienced soldiers
  - two war dogs assigned to the squad
  - two squads of 5, led by a 3rd level ranger or warrior
  - patrol led by a 4th level ranger (maybe multi-classed)
- human, dwarven and half-orc SF bros
  - ward walkers or something
  - patrol on dire wolves and bears
  - have pseudodragons as drones
- Gnome wet-work gal
  - couple levels in monk, 3-4 in rogue
  - PCs escort her to enemy outpost or something
- Soldiers are fitted with steel collars which are marked with their rank
  - welded/forged shut: cannot be removed w/o sundering collar
    - actually, should probably be brands or tattoos
  - if the PCs run, they are known by the collars as deserters
    - 5-10 deserters in crow cages at entrance to camp, some dead, some dying

First adventure
---------------

PCs awake in caged wagon (roll Fort to decide order). Driven by veteran missing
arm and with hideous scar cutting through left eye, cheekbone and ear
- last memory is of drinking in tavern

1hr later, they arrive at Someones or Somethings Ward, a frontier outpost and
training base. Soldiers stationed here are known as Wardens. They are kind of
like LRRPs/Rangers.
- Removed from cage in presence of overwhelming force
- fitted with steel collar
- processed, issued uniform and training gear
- given charge, like an oath, but not voluntary
  - "You are charged to something something honor blah for 5 yrs or until
    relieved by death"
- taken to be Sorted
  - like a confidence course, but more dangerous
  - not deadly, necessarily, but some will get hurt
  - PCs put through in a group
  - some members of groups ahead and behind dont do as well
  - those that fail are sent to the front as infantry
    - there, they will fight until they die or are wounded too badly to fight
  - make sure the PCs survive, natch
- meet their squad leader
  - faint but distinct burn scarring across top half of his body
  - fought on the line in the Blight
  - greviously wounded at second battle of something something
    - his squad charged a battle mage
    - killed him, but with his last breath, the mage cast fireball on himself
    - squad leader caught in the blast, 3rd-degree burns across top half of body
    - healed by cleric, but scarred
- everyone is then formed up for speech by the Wardmaster (base CO)
  - about 2 minutes in, catapult attack from beyond the wire
  - give PCs a perception check (DC 25) if made, they get one round to act
  - Wardmaster hears the catapult, yells to take cover
  - projectile sprays parade ground with darts
  - dragon takes off and burns down the source of the attack
- PCs squad sent to do damage assessment and check for survivors
  - have to fight some baddies
- After return to base, sent on patrol to look for more infiltrators
  - design adventure so they level on the way out
