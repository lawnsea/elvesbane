- draft intro email
  - purpose is to be a teaser
  - summary of elven catastrophe and start of war
  - written in the style of an RPG call-to-action
- create private repo
  - use github pages for player-visible info (including a blog)
    - https://pages.github.com/
  - license it CC BY-NC-SA
  - use parallel private and public trees
    - people
    - places
    - events
    - etc.
  - private tree has the DM-only info
- create public repo for players to use?
  - they could then edit things in the wiki
  - maybe more work than it is worth
  - it might be possible to instead do a private org site and give them access
    - then my fork has the DM-only stuff
    - they can use the wiki
- content to create
  - high-level history
  - high-level geography
  - religion
  - place names
  - story graphs
